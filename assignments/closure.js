// ==== Challenge 1: Write your own closure ====
// Write a closure of your own creation.
// Keep it simple! Remember a closure is just a function
// that manipulates variables defined in the outer scope.
// The outer scope can be a parent function, or the top level of the script.
function football(league) {
  const offense = "Pro-Style";
  const defense = "3-4";
  console.log(`Many teams in the NFL run the ${offense} type of offense and the ${defense} defense`);

  function team (teamName) {
    const players = 53;
    console.log(`Each team can man a roster of ${players} players`);

    function position(positions) {
      const mostImportant = "QB"
      console.log(`${mostImportant} is the most important position on the field. Out of ${players} players, he is needed more than anyone in the ${offense} offense`)
    }
  }
}

// ==== Challenge 2: Implement a "counter maker" function ====
const counterMaker = () => {
  // IMPLEMENTATION OF counterMaker:
  // 1- Declare a `count` variable with a value of 0. We will be mutating it, so declare it using `let`!
  // 2- Declare a function `counter`. It should increment and return `count`.
  //      NOTE: This `counter` function, being nested inside `counterMaker`,
  //      "closes over" the `count` variable. It can "see" it in the parent scope!
  // 3- Return the `counter` function.
};
// Example usage: const myCounter = counterMaker();
// myCounter(); // 1
// myCounter(); // 2

// ==== Challenge 3: Make `counterMaker` more sophisticated ====
// It should have a `limit` parameter. Any counters we make with `counterMaker`
// will refuse to go over the limit, and start back at 1.

// ==== Challenge 4: Create a counter function with an object that can increment and decrement ====
const counterFactory = () => {
  // Return an object that has two methods called `increment` and `decrement`.
  // `increment` should increment a counter variable in closure scope and return it.
  // `decrement` should decrement the counter variable and return it.
};
